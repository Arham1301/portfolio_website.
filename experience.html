                <p class="text1">During my internship at Maiti Labs, I contributed to enhancing the company's website,
                    focusing on key sections like About and Careers. I implemented design updates to improve aesthetics
                    and usability, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes. Additionally,
                    I developed and integrated the new GreenBit feature into the homepage, further enriching the site’s
                    functionality and user engagement. I collaborated closely with the design team to align the new
                    features with the company’s branding. My work also involved optimizing the website’s performance,
                    resulting in faster load times and improved user satisfaction. This experience allowed me to refine
                    my skills in responsive web design and cross-functional teamwork.</p>

                <p class="text2">The 1st MIT SPEED CHESS CHAMPIONSHIP was conducted successfully on 17th & 18th November
                    with the aim to provide a platform for chess players in the institute and attract newcomers to the
                    game.We were thrilled to receive over 120 registrations, primarily from 1st-year students, and had
                    about 75 participants despite scheduling conflicts with club interviews. The tournament, with no
                    entry fees and a time control of 10 mins + 5 secs, featured 4 rounds on the first day and 3 on the
                    second. The event ran smoothly, and the enthusiastic response encouraged us to consider organizing
                    more such tournaments in the future.</p>
